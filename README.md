#### Objectives:
Data modeling is the first step in a database design. It is a process of creating a data model for the software in question to store data in a database. By using data models, stakeholders such as data analysts, BI specialists and data engineers can decide how the data will be used when designing a database or data warehouses.

In this training, we will start with modeling entity relationship diagrams and logical and physical modeling. We continue to learn about relational algebra operations, data normalization rules, among other features. Finally, let's understand the SQL language, which is used to manipulate data from a database.
